h2. What the heck is that?

These examples are from Ruby BarCamp '09 in Kiev, Ukraine. I did not really prepare much, and
I had no slides at all, so some comments probably would be great.

I am going to explain a few ideas from the talk, and what I had no time to talk about, in this README.
Eventually. Right now, I just love to hang out away from my Mac!
